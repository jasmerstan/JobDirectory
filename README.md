This project is build to create an Restful API to perform create, update, delete and retrieve all the data from the table. 
The API is build from ASP.Net Core Web API, we can perform the above action by using @Get, @POST, @DELETE, @UPDATE method.
Othe than that, in order to better demonstrate how the actions is being performed, a simple UI is created with ASP.NET Core MVC.
EntityFrameworkCore packages is being used to add-migration and update-database.
AutoMapper packages is being used to simplify the process of assign variable into different data type.
